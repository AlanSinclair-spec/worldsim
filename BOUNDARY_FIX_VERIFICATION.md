# El Salvador Map Boundary Fix - Verification Guide

## What Was Changed

### Before (Squares/Rectangles)
The regions.json file had simple rectangular bounding boxes with only 5 coordinate points:
```json
"coordinates": [[
  [-89.287, 13.799],  // Top-left
  [-89.087, 13.799],  // Top-right
  [-89.087, 13.599],  // Bottom-right
  [-89.287, 13.599],  // Bottom-left
  [-89.287, 13.799]   // Close polygon
]]
```

This created **perfect rectangles** that didn't match the actual department boundaries.

### After (Realistic Polygons)
Each department now has realistic polygon geometries with 10-30 coordinate points:

**Example: San Salvador**
```json
"coordinates": [[
  [-89.327, 13.821],
  [-89.241, 13.842],
  [-89.158, 13.861],
  [-89.081, 13.889],
  [-89.023, 13.927],
  [-89.001, 13.841],
  [-89.031, 13.763],
  [-89.089, 13.697],
  [-89.163, 13.651],
  [-89.231, 13.671],
  [-89.285, 13.693],
  [-89.327, 13.761],
  [-89.327, 13.821]
]]
```

This creates an **irregular polygon** (13 points) that approximates the actual shape of San Salvador department.

## Verification Checklist

### 1. Visual Inspection
Open the interactive map at: **http://localhost:3009/interactive**

**What to check:**
- [ ] Departments are no longer rectangular/square boxes
- [ ] Boundaries follow realistic irregular shapes
- [ ] No obvious gaps between departments
- [ ] No overlapping departments
- [ ] Map looks similar to real El Salvador political map

### 2. All 14 Departments Present
Verify all departments render correctly:

1. **Western Region:**
   - [ ] Ahuachapán (AH) - northwest corner
   - [ ] Santa Ana (SA) - west-central
   - [ ] Sonsonate (SO) - southwest coast

2. **Northern Region:**
   - [ ] Chalatenango (CH) - north-central

3. **Central Region:**
   - [ ] La Libertad (LI) - central coast
   - [ ] San Salvador (SS) - capital, central
   - [ ] Cuscatlán (CU) - central
   - [ ] La Paz (LP) - central-south
   - [ ] Cabañas (CA) - central-north
   - [ ] San Vicente (SV) - central

4. **Eastern Region:**
   - [ ] Usulután (US) - southeast coast
   - [ ] Morazán (MO) - northeast
   - [ ] San Miguel (SM) - east-central
   - [ ] La Unión (LU) - far east

### 3. Interactive Features Still Work
- [ ] Clicking a department shows popup with name and statistics
- [ ] Hovering over department highlights it
- [ ] Stress colors display correctly on departments
- [ ] Department labels appear in correct positions

### 4. 2D/3D Modes Both Work
- [ ] 2D mode shows flat map with proper boundaries
- [ ] 3D mode shows terrain with departments draped over terrain
- [ ] Toggle button switches smoothly between modes
- [ ] Reset View button works in both modes

### 5. Simulation Results Display Correctly
Run a simulation and verify:
- [ ] Stress colors apply to department polygons (not squares)
- [ ] All 14 departments get colored based on stress levels
- [ ] Results panel shows correct department names
- [ ] Chart visualizations work correctly

## Technical Validation

### GeoJSON Structure
```bash
# Validate JSON structure
node -e "const data = require('./public/regions.json'); console.log('Valid:', data.type === 'FeatureCollection' && data.features.length === 14);"

# Count coordinate points per department
node -e "const data = require('./public/regions.json'); data.features.forEach(f => console.log(f.properties.name, ':', f.geometry.coordinates[0].length, 'points'));"
```

Expected output:
```
Ahuachapán : 13 points
Santa Ana : 14 points
Sonsonate : 16 points
Chalatenango : 21 points
La Libertad : 14 points
San Salvador : 13 points
Cuscatlán : 11 points
La Paz : 20 points
Cabañas : 17 points
San Vicente : 19 points
Usulután : 29 points
Morazán : 27 points
San Miguel : 18 points
La Unión : 32 points
```

### Coordinate Bounds
All coordinates should be within El Salvador's bounding box:
- **Longitude**: -90.13 to -87.69 (west to east)
- **Latitude**: 13.15 to 14.45 (south to north)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Departments still look like rectangles
**Solution**: Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) to clear cached regions.json

### Issue: Map shows gaps or overlaps
**Solution**: The polygons are approximate. Small gaps are acceptable. Large gaps indicate coordinate errors.

### Issue: Stress colors don't display
**Solution**: Check that MapView3D is properly rendering the GeoJSON data with fill colors.

### Issue: 3D mode doesn't show departments
**Solution**: Ensure terrain source is added before polygon layers.

## Success Criteria

✅ **Map displays El Salvador's 14 departments with realistic, irregular polygon boundaries (not rectangles)**

✅ **All interactive features work correctly**

✅ **Stress visualization colors departments properly**

✅ **Both 2D and 3D modes function correctly**

## Next Steps (If Issues Found)

1. **Refine polygon coordinates**: Adjust coordinate points for better accuracy
2. **Add simplification**: Reduce polygon complexity for better performance
3. **Improve labeling**: Adjust label positions for irregular shapes
4. **Enhance boundaries**: Add more detail to coastal and border regions

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Regions.json updated with realistic polygon boundaries for all 14 El Salvador departments.
