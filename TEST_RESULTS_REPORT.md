## Next Steps for Full Launch

### Minor Fixes Needed

1. **Fix Model Test Mocking** (model.test.ts)
   - Issue: Circular dependency in Supabase mock
   - Solution: Restructure mock imports

2. **Fix API Route Test Mocking** (simulate/route.test.ts)

   - Solution: Add global Request mock to jest.setup.js

3. **Run Playwright E2E Tests**
   - Start dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Execute: `npx playwright test`
   - Generate report: `npx playwright show-report`
